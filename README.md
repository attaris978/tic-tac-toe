<h1>Instructions For Use</h1>

Play. Enjoy.

<h1>What the Future Holds</h1>

1) Implement logic to allow the user to play against the "computer"
2) Create an express server/api to allow for auth/login and data persistence
3) Offload "computer's turn" logic to the server to prevent client-side reverse engineering
4) Enable users to play against one another using the api
5) Add Blackjack and merge into React-Router based app
