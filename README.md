<p>Run '<i>npm run start</i>' to launch the app.</p>

<h1>Instructions For Use</h1>

Play. Enjoy.

<h1>What the Future Holds</h1>

1) Add stateful record of player wins/losses
2) Implement logic to allow the user to play against the "computer"
3) Create an express server/api to allow for auth/login and data persistence
4) Offload "computer's turn" logic to the server to prevent client-side reverse engineering
5) Enable users to play against one another using the api
6) Add Blackjack and merge into React-Router based app
